          <p>
            JavaScript (not to be confused with Java) was created in 1995 by <strong>Brendan Eich</strong>, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript: the original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript,
            then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1996-1997 JavaScript was taken to <strong>ECMA</strong> to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape. The work done over this period of time eventually led to the official release of <strong>ECMAScript</strong>. It is the name of the official standard,
            with JavaScript being the most well-known of the implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standards process continued in cycles, with releases of <strong>ECMAScript 2</strong> in 1998 and <strong>ECMAScript 3</strong> in 1999, which is the baseline for modern day JavaScript. The "JS2" or "original ES4" work led by <strong>Waldemar Horwat</strong> (then of Netscape, now at Google) started in 2000 and at first,
            Microsoft seemed to participate and even implemented some of the proposals in their JScript.net language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the open source and developer communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with JavaScript. <strong>Jesse James Garrett</strong> released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax, and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background.
            This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Libraries such as Prototype, jQuery, Dojo and Mootools and others being released.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this then brings us to today, with JavaScript entering a completely new and exciting cycle of evolution, innovation and standardisation, allowing us to use JavaScript on the server-side, and more. It is an exciting time to learn JavaScript.

            This chapter introduces the concept of web scrioting and the JavaScript language. As the chapter moves ahead, you'll learn hot to include JavaScript commands directly in your HTML documents, and how your scripts will be executed when the page is viewed in a browser.
            You will work with a simple script, edit it, and test it in your browser, all the while learning the basic tasks involved in creating and using JavaScript script.
